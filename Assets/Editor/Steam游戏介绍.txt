雷诺德，一位怀揣梦想的青年，他出生于这个时代有名商人世家——尹泽瑞尔家族，家族历 史悠久的经商传统让他从幼年起就目睹父母经商和与人打交道的情景。于是他从小便梦想自 己能拥有自己的庄园，雇佣员工管理农园和牧场。成年后，他立志要实现自己的事业梦想。 过完 18 岁成人礼后的雷诺德带着一笔金币离开了家乡，预备离开熟悉的地方，前往外地闯 荡一番，并渴望拥有一个属于自己的岛屿。
他找到了一个名为伊桑迪尔的小岛，准备把这个地方租借下来一展宏图。伊桑迪尔有着迷人 的传说:那里蕴藏着悠久的历史，隐藏着无数的秘密和财富。少年心怀大志，租下了这块神 秘之地，签订了严苛的契约。契约规定，雷诺德必须完成双重任务:首先，他要经营岛上的 农场，将其开垦成富饶的领地;其次，他须在岛上远行，完成一系列冒险任务。每一项任务 的完成都将带来物资和金币奖励，但若失败，他就必须支付昂贵的罚金。

  English Version
In the expanse of the Aviyar Archipelago, there lies a coveted island known as Isandale. Nestled in the azure sea, it awaits a true master to tend to its every detail. Young Reynald became the focus of attention for having acquired the dream island that adventurers coveted within this archipelago. Born into a family of merchants, Reynald witnessed his parents' business dealings and interactions with people from a young age. Consequently, he harbored a dream of owning his estate, hiring employees to manage farms and pastures.
However, the lease contract for the island was exceptionally stringent—not only did he have to work on the farm, but he also had to complete various adventurous tasks, or else face hefty fines. Yet, adventure and reward always coexisted. In the Heroes' Camp, he learned combat and survival skills; in the snowy wilderness and frosty swamps, he challenged the unknown. In the Valley City-States and the Shipwright's Coast, he befriended merchant nobles.
Having experienced the fear of pirate ships, the allure of the grazing plains, the trial of flaming wildfires, and the adventure of the Goo Goo Mountains, his adventurous spirit drove him to challenge himself time and time again. In the end, he not only became an outstanding warrior and merchant but also transformed the once desolate island into a thriving paradise.
 Part One: Brief Synopsis:
         
  Part Two: Detailed Description:
In the Avialar Archipelago, there is a coveted island on the map called Isandir. It is nestled in the deep blue sea, waiting for a true master to manage it meticulously.
Renold, a young dreamer, was born into the renowned merchant family, the Yezerel family, in this era. The long-standing business tradition of the family allowed him to witness his parents’ business dealings from a young age. As a result, he dreamt of owning his own estate and employing staff to manage a farm and ranch. As an adult, he aspired to make his entrepreneurial dreams come true. After his 18th birthday, Renold left his hometown with a sum of gold coins, ready to leave the familiar place and explore other lands, with the desire to own his own island.
He found a small island named Isandir and prepared to lease it to fulfill his grand ambitions. Isandir had fascinating legends: it held ancient history, countless secrets, and wealth. With great aspirations, Renold leased this mysterious place and signed a strict contract. The contract required Renold to fulfill dual tasks: firstly, he had to manage the island’s farm and develop it into a prosperous territory; secondly, he had to embark on adventures on the island and complete a series of quests. Each completed task would bring material and gold rewards, but failure would result in costly fines.
On the beautiful island of Isandir, Renold showcased extraordinary managerial talents. On the abandoned land demarcated by the island’s lord, he gradually grasped the workings of a farm. He became familiar with the barn’s system, crop planting and harvesting seasons, and how to utilize the resources of the surrounding
          
  environment. Renold established friendships with the local farmers, sharing knowledge and experiences between them. Renold’s arrival changed the lives of Isandir’s residents. While he managed the farm meticulously, he also hired these land-loving farmers to help with crop harvesting and transportation. As time passed, with the assistance of his hired workers, Renold not only completed one contract task after another but also used his keen business insights to transform the farm into the island’s core industry.
Under Renold’s governance, Isandir Island flourished with new vitality. The farms on the island gradually developed, yielding bountiful crops and abundant livestock. While Renold valued the economic benefits of the farms, he also focused on environmental protection and sustainable development, leading the island ’ s agriculture and animal husbandry industries onto a green path. He introduced modern agricultural facilities and technology, increasing crop yield and quality, and earning widespread recognition for Isandir’s agricultural produce. Simultaneously, Renold encouraged farmers to adopt organic farming and ecological breeding, making agricultural production on the island more environmentally friendly and sustainable. In a short period, this barren land experienced a tremendous reversal from nothing to prosperity.
Of course, Isandir Island was a land of both opportunity and challenges. In this land, there were many unknown dangers. The island’s diverse ecosystems filled outsiders with curiosity and hostility. However, as long as adventurers possessed enough wisdom and courage to face difficulties, fate could bestow unimaginable
          
  rewards upon them. This mysterious and resource-rich island possessed many precious raw materials. By completing corresponding adventure quests, one could obtain a large number of scarce farm resources, which undoubtedly tempted Renold greatly. After stabilizing the farm’s operations, Renold prepared to embark on adventures on the island, completing a series of quests. Each task’s completion would bring material and gold rewards. He embarked on a unique adventure journey with some of his farm employees, starting from the adventurer camp on the island. This camp was a source of knowledge and power for those entering Isandir. After passing the camp’s trials, they experienced the terror of pirate battleships, the allure of the horse-rearing grassland, the test of raging wildfires, and the exploration of the Gugu Mountain Range. They embarked on a survival journey filled with adventure and challenges in this land. All this was to unlock the potential of Isandir Island and to fight for their own protection and the farm’s development.
Despite the various hardships, Renold and his employees did not retreat but instead grew rapidly through practical combat. As expected, Renold successfully completed the island lord’s test, providing opportunities for the younger generation and teaching them bravery and resilience. People respected and regarded him as an indispensable member. With Renold’s help, the residents of Isandir became more confident and courageous in facing external challenges. They learned from him how to seize their own destiny, and his existence made them believe that with cooperation and unity, they could overcome any difficulties.
The island’s adventurous journey gradually gained more attention, attracting
          
  more adventurers to come. Renold transformed the adventurer camp into a comprehensive institution that combined training, communication, and exploration. Here, adventurers could receive skill training, equipment upgrades, and organize expedition teams for various quests. Over time, many adventurers established their own adventure companies and exploratory teams on the island, providing security services, exploration guidance, and rare commodities to the island’s residents, driving the development of the entire island.
During the island’s adventures, Renold himself continuously surpassed his limits and gained more wealth and fame. He resolved the threat of the Dragon of Wolong Valley, challenged the evil god in the Lost Forest, and defused the invasion threat in the Glacier Cave. Each adventure allowed Renold to grow and brought more opportunities and wealth to his farm and Isandir Island.
In addition to managing daily farm tasks, Renold formed connections with a group of aristocratic merchants, learning how to handle complex trade affairs and demonstrate his business talents. Soon, he became a shining star in the most important commercial port on the island, planning to obtain more financial support through trade. Through his interactions with the merchants, Renold opened up a new world. The Basin City-States were bustling commercial centers, with various goods and precious items flowing in continuously. Renold gained an in-depth understanding of trade secrets, learning how to handle complex business transactions. Through interactions with the merchants, he learned the laws and trends of the market. Renold discovered business opportunities and began to
          
  explore the hidden opportunities behind the market to seek greater benefits. He learned how to assess the value and scarcity of goods and gained negotiation skills to secure more favorable trading conditions. Renold’s business acumen and courageous spirit quickly earned him the respect of the business community. The merchants opened their doors to cooperation, willing to work closely with him. They jointly planned and implemented various business projects, taking trade activities in the Basin City-States to new heights.
Using the funds he earned, Renold began to invest in more business areas. He established his own business empire, owning ships, factories, and mines, among other assets. He employed a strong team to manage his business empire in collaboration with the merchants. Renold’s business success aroused jealousy and competition from other nobles in the city-states. However, he did not fade away; on the contrary, he used his business acumen to maintain his leading position. He demonstrated superior decision-making abilities and wisdom in business competition, steadily developing his business empire. Renold always saw business as an opportunity for creation and development. His success not only showcased his business talents but also expressed his enthusiasm for trade and economic development. As a business giant, Renold not only achieved fame and fortune but also brought prosperity and progress to the city-states through his influence and wealth. In the trading center on the island, Renold actively introduced trading companies and factories, attracting numerous merchants and investors to settle. Isandir became a prosperous commercial city, where various goods gathered,
          
  attracting merchants and customers from all over the world. At the same time, the island’s fair and transparent business environment attracted a group of outstanding business talents. Together with local enterprises, they contributed to the glory of Isandir’s business.
As time passed, Renold gained the respect and admiration of the island’s people. He became the leader of the island, leading Isandir towards prosperity and harmony. He focused on improving people’s livelihoods, constructing various infrastructure and providing public services such as education, healthcare, and culture. He actively promoted the development of culture and arts, bringing more spiritual enjoyment and cultural enrichment to the island’s people. At the same time, his adventurous stories attracted more and more people to explore and engage in trade, gradually transforming Isandir from an unknown island into a vibrant trading center and a paradise for adventurers. People pursued their dreams here and enjoyed a high quality of life. Due to Renold’s courage and wisdom, he became a shining legendary figure on this island.
When the story finally came to an end, Renold was no longer the young adventurer he once was. He had become a respected lord, a business tycoon, and the protagonist of adventure legends. His name, along with Isandir Island, became the most legendary symbol of that era.
